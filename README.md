# Meetings (what we agreed upon)
- Meeting 1
  - understand and look for papers about optical music recognition.
  - understand how to do written letters recognition.
  - Preprocesing 
    - fix image rotation using ( prespectve and affine transformation) 
    - detect angle of rotation of the image using hough transform of the lines
    - remove noise and unobvious lines
  - processing
    - detect the 11 types of the characters and how to feature-engineer them.
    
# papers 
  - papers that describe general character recognition

# plan
  -update 13/12/2020
    - we need to do the following
       - we need someone to work on adjusting the image eg.music2.JPG to be similar to music1.JPG Hint(he should look for non-affine transformation)         
       - we need 2 people to work on extracting features of each symbol.
       - we need someone to integrate the work of the different stages.
